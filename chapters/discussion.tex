\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

In the coordination world, Reo is well known for its variety on extensions and semantics\cite{Jongmans2012}. And this is, of course, not the first work on its timed or stochastic semantics. Here we take \emph{timed Reo}, \emph{probabilistic Reo}, and \emph{stochastic Reo} as examples, to illustrate how our new model differs from its predecessors.

\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent{\emph{Timed Reo.}} Time was natively involved in Reo from its very beginning\cite{ARBAB2004}, where \emph{FIFO1} channel needs time constraints to ensure its retardancy. However, time was involved, only implicitly, in this semantics instead of syntax. And in some other semantics like \emph{constraint automata}, time is even simplified to logic order. Then \cite{Arbab2006} proposed the raw \emph{t-Timer} channels to capture timed delays. This work was then followed and extended in \cite{Meng2007} and \cite{Meng2012} with different types of timed channels.

The \emph{pTimer} channel here in our work is basically an improvement of t\emph{Timer} in \cite{Meng2012}. A \emph{Timer}t channel accepts data values and proceed timeout signals after a certain delay. However, it does not describe what happens if the timeout signal fails to deliver. In some cases, this will lead to timelock.

\emph{Timelock} have different meaning in different semantics. Informally speaking, a timed model falls into timelock if and only if there's no possible evolution that satisfies the model constraints, and hence the model execution is forced to stop. From a practical view, a connector suffering from timelock can not be simulated or implemented. And even in theoretical senarios \cite{Li2015}, it may also lead to inconsistency in proving frameworks as an unsatisfiable proposition \emph{False} derives everything.


\begin{example}[Timelock in Timed Reo]
    The \emph{Timer}t channels may easily lead to timelock. For example, in Fig.~\ref{fig:timelock}, there are two \emph{Timert}s, one is located between $A$ and $C$, the other between $B$ and $D$. According to the original definition of \emph{Timer}t in \cite{Arbab2006} and \cite{Meng2012}, we can derive that,
    \[
        \forall i\in\mathbb{N}, t_i(C)=t_i(A)+0.5, t_i(D)=t_i(B)+1,t_i(A)=t_i(B), t_i(C)=t_i(D)\quad (*)
    \]
    where $t(X)$ indicates the time stream on node $X$. For example, if $A$ accepts the first value at $0$, and the second value at $1$, then $t_0(A)=0,t_1(A)=1,\cdots$. From equation(*), it's easy to derive that $t(A) = t(A) + 0.5$. This connector will be trapped in timelock once $A$ starts accepting values.

        \caption{Timelock Caused by Abuse of \emph{Timer}t}
    \end{figure}
\end{example}

In comparison, \emph{pTimer} channels are timelock-free. If its sink end is not ready, the timeout signal will be dropped, and it channel will become available to accept new values again.

Further more, \emph{pTimer} channels also support reconfiguration of delay. In an original \emph{Timer}t channel, the delay is assigned when encoding the connector, and cannot be rewritten during execution. As a result, when formalizing specific timed connectors, we still need other channels like \emph{reset-timer}, \emph{expired-timer} and so on. In our framework, \emph{pTimer} is capable to represent all these channels with only simple combination patterns.

\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent{\emph{Probabilistic Reo.}} \cite{Models2005} came up with a probabilistic extension of constraint automata, to formalize the potential lossy behavior in connectors.

In \cite{Models2005}, probabilistic loss may happens while being transmitted or waiting in buffer. Definition of the former case is rather trivial, but in the latter one, discrete time is required and formalized as time units. The authors assume that in each time unit, a buffer failure may happens with probability $\tau$, and data values will get lost due to this failure.

In Section \ref{sec:casestudies}, we have already shown that probabilistic lossy channels can be represented by combination of \emph{StochasticChoice} channels and \emph{SyncDrain} channels. Actually, \emph{pTimer} channels is also capable to produce discrete time signals. Thus, we can use probablistic lossy channels and discrete time counters to reproduce the \emph{LossyFIFO1} in \cite{Models2005}.


\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent{\emph{Stochastic Reo.}} Baier and Wolf proposed the first stochastic extension for Reo in \cite{Baier2006} based on continuous-time constraint automata (CCA). The work was later extended with different semantics. For example, quantitative constraint automata in \cite{Arbab2009} and interactive markov chain in \cite{Oliveira2016}.

Basically, most of those stochastic semantics are based on continuous-time markov chains. Delays and arrival rates are attached to all the primitive channels, giving them randomized and unreliable behavior. This approach has a defect that random behavior is bounded with time. We can produce random delays but not random values. That's the reason why we split off stochastic delays as \emph{StochasticChoice}. \emph{StochasticChoice} has nothing to do with time, but we can always combine it with \emph{pTimer} to produce different timed connectors.

\ly{
    There are also other coordination models that supports stochastic and timed behavior except for Reo. For example, Probabilistic KLAIM in \cite{Pierro2004}, Stochastic $\pi$-caculus in \cite{Priami95}, etc. However, most of them provide support for modeling not only connecors, but also components. This makes it possible to model timed and stochastic behavior in the component part, and do not need extra coordination primitives. Compared with these approaches, our framework supports more complicated coordination behaviors and more intuitive modeling interfaces (graphical representation), which also keep connector designers away from potential failures.
