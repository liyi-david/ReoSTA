\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper comes up with an approach using Reo connectors to capture stochastic and real-time behavior in distributed systems. With an extended set of primitive channels, stochastic choices and timed delays are encapsulated as individual channels. As a theoretical framework, our approach supports partial reconfiguration (by rewritable \emph{pTimer}) and various statistical distributions (by highly customizable \emph{StochasticChoice}). And the case studies also prove its capacity to formalize complex coordination senarios in the real world. We use $\nSTA$ as the formal semantics of stochastic and timed connectors, which is purely operational and timelock-free.

The framework, however, is still in its infancy. We need an implementation to make it compatible with popular formal tools. Currently, our plan is to encode $\nSTA$ as STA so that it can be supported by JANI. JANI (JSON Automata Network Interface) \cite{JaniSpec} is an unified analysis framework including a shared model specification that covers STA, and a standard analyzing interface supported by various probabilistic model checking tools (Modest\cite{Hartmanns12}, IscasMC\cite{HahnYiFM14}, etc.).
